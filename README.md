# [Andrew Rosemberg](https://github.com/andrewrosemberg/AndrewRosemberg)

I am a PhD student in the [School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), under the guidance of [Dr. Pascal Van Hentenryck](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck). My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and their practical applications within the realm of energy systems and sustainability.

Presently, I am actively engaged as a researcher at the [Artificial Intelligence Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4OPT)](https://www.ai4opt.org/).
